Regular Expression HOWTO
------------------------
Regular expressions (called REs, or regexes, or regex patterns) are essentially a tiny, highly specialized programming language embedded inside Python and made available through the re module. Using this little language, you specify the rules for the set of possible strings that you want to match; this set might contain English sentences, or e-mail addresses, or TeX commands, or anything you like. You can then ask questions such as “Does this string match the pattern?”, or “Is there a match for the pattern anywhere in this string?”. You can also use REs to modify a string or to split it apart in various ways.

Regular expression patterns are compiled into a series of bytecodes which are then executed by a matching engine written in C. For advanced use, it may be necessary to pay careful attention to how the engine will execute a given RE, and write the RE in a certain way in order to produce bytecode that runs faster. Optimization isn’t covered in this document, because it requires that you have a good understanding of the matching engine’s internals.

The regular expression language is relatively small and restricted, so not all possible string processing tasks can be done using regular expressions. There are also tasks that can be done with regular expressions, but the expressions turn out to be very complicated. In these cases, you may be better off writing Python code to do the processing; while Python code will be slower than an elaborate regular expression, it will also probably be more understandable.

Simple Patterns
We’ll start by learning about the simplest possible regular expressions. Since regular expressions are used to operate on strings, we’ll begin with the most common task: matching characters.

For a detailed explanation of the computer science underlying regular expressions (deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata), you can refer to almost any textbook on writing compilers.

Matching Characters
--------------------
Most letters and characters will simply match themselves. For example, the regular expression test will match the string test exactly. (You can enable a case-insensitive mode that would let this RE match Test or TEST as well; more about this later.)

There are exceptions to this rule; some characters are special metacharacters, and don’t match themselves. Instead, they signal that some out-of-the-ordinary thing should be matched, or they affect other portions of the RE by repeating them or changing their meaning. Much of this document is devoted to discussing various metacharacters and what they do.

Here’s a complete list of the metacharacters; their meanings will be discussed in the rest of this HOWTO.
. ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )

The first metacharacters we’ll look at are [ and ]. They’re used for specifying a character class, which is a set of characters that you wish to match. Characters can be listed individually, or a range of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a '-'. For example, [abc] will match any of the characters a, b, or c; this is the same as [a-c], which uses a range to express the same set of characters. If you wanted to match only lowercase letters, your RE would be [a-z].

Metacharacters are not active inside classes. For example, [akm$] will match any of the characters 'a', 'k', 'm', or '$'; '$' is usually a metacharacter, but inside a character class it’s stripped of its special nature.

You can match the characters not listed within the class by complementing the set. This is indicated by including a '^' as the first character of the class. For example, [^5] will match any character except '5'. If the caret appears elsewhere in a character class, it does not have special meaning. For example: [5^] will match either a '5' or a '^'.

Perhaps the most important metacharacter is the backslash, \. As in Python string literals, the backslash can be followed by various characters to signal various special sequences. It’s also used to escape all the metacharacters so you can still match them in patterns; for example, if you need to match a [ or \, you can precede them with a backslash to remove their special meaning: \[ or \\.

Some of the special sequences beginning with '\' represent predefined sets of characters that are often useful, such as the set of digits, the set of letters, or the set of anything that isn’t whitespace.

Let’s take an example: \w matches any alphanumeric character. If the regex pattern is expressed in bytes, this is equivalent to the class [a-zA-Z0-9_]. If the regex pattern is a string, \w will match all the characters marked as letters in the Unicode database provided by the unicodedata module. You can use the more restricted definition of \w in a string pattern by supplying the re.ASCII flag when compiling the regular expression.

The following list of special sequences isn’t complete. For a complete list of sequences and expanded class definitions for Unicode string patterns, see the last part of Regular Expression Syntax in the Standard Library reference. In general, the Unicode versions match any character that’s in the appropriate category in the Unicode database.

\d --> Matches any decimal digit; this is equivalent to the class [0-9].
\D --> Matches any non-digit character; this is equivalent to the class [^0-9].
\s --> Matches any whitespace character; this is equivalent to the class [ \t\n\r\f\v].
\S --> Matches any non-whitespace character; this is equivalent to the class [^ \t\n\r\f\v].
\w --> Matches any alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the class [a-zA-Z0-9_].
\W --> Matches any non-alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the class [^a-zA-Z0-9_].
These sequences can be included inside a character class. For example, [\s,.] is a character class that will match any whitespace character, or ',' or '.'.

The final metacharacter in this section is .. It matches anything except a newline character, and there’s an alternate mode (re.DOTALL) where it will match even a newline. . is often used where you want to match “any character”.

Repeating Things
-----------------
Repeating Things
Being able to match varying sets of characters is the first thing regular expressions can do that isn’t already possible with the methods available on strings. However, if that was the only additional capability of regexes, they wouldn’t be much of an advance. Another capability is that you can specify that portions of the RE must be repeated a certain number of times.

The first metacharacter for repeating things that we’ll look at is *. * doesn’t match the literal character '*'; instead, it specifies that the previous character can be matched zero or more times, instead of exactly once.

For example, ca*t will match 'ct' (0 'a' characters), 'cat' (1 'a'), 'caaat' (3 'a' characters), and so forth.

Repetitions such as * are greedy; when repeating a RE, the matching engine will try to repeat it as many times as possible. If later portions of the pattern don’t match, the matching engine will then back up and try again with fewer repetitions.

A step-by-step example will make this more obvious. Let’s consider the expression a[bcd]*b. This matches the letter 'a', zero or more letters from the class [bcd], and finally ends with a 'b'. Now imagine matching this RE against the string 'abcbd'.


Step    Matched             Explanation
1       a           The a in the RE matches.
2       abcbd       The engine matches [bcd]*, going as far as it can, which is to the end of the string.
3       Failure     The engine tries to match b, but the current position is at the end of the string, so it fails.
4       abcb        Back up, so that [bcd]* matches one less character.
5       Failure     Try b again, but the current position is at the last character, which is a 'd'.
6       abc         Back up again, so that [bcd]* is only matching bc.
7       abcb        Try b again. This time the character at the current position is 'b', so it succeeds.

The end of the RE has now been reached, and it has matched 'abcb'. This demonstrates how the matching engine goes as far as it can at first, and if no match is found it will then progressively back up and retry the rest of the RE again and again. It will back up until it has tried zero matches for [bcd]*, and if that subsequently fails, the engine will conclude that the string doesn’t match the RE at all.

Another repeating metacharacter is +, which matches one or more times. Pay careful attention to the difference between * and +; * matches zero or more times, so whatever’s being repeated may not be present at all, while + requires at least one occurrence. To use a similar example, ca+t will match 'cat' (1 'a'), 'caaat' (3 'a's), but won’t match 'ct'.

There are two more repeating qualifiers. The question mark character, ?, matches either once or zero times; you can think of it as marking something as being optional. For example, home-?brew matches either 'homebrew' or 'home-brew'.

The most complicated repeated qualifier is {m,n}, where m and n are decimal integers. This qualifier means there must be at least m repetitions, and at most n. For example, a/{1,3}b will match 'a/b', 'a//b', and 'a///b'. It won’t match 'ab', which has no slashes, or 'a////b', which has four.

You can omit either m or n; in that case, a reasonable value is assumed for the missing value. Omitting m is interpreted as a lower limit of 0, while omitting n results in an upper bound of infinity.

Readers of a reductionist bent may notice that the three other qualifiers can all be expressed using this notation. {0,} is the same as *, {1,} is equivalent to +, and {0,1} is the same as ?. It’s better to use *, +, or ? when you can, simply because they’re shorter and easier to read.

Using Regular Expressions
Now that we’ve looked at some simple regular expressions, how do we actually use them in Python? The re module provides an interface to the regular expression engine, allowing you to compile REs into objects and then perform matches with them.

import re
p = re.compile('ab*')
p #### re.compile(r'ab*', re.UNICODE)

re.compile() also accepts an optional flags argument, used to enable various special features and syntax variations. We’ll go over the available settings later, but for now a single example will do:
p = re.compile('ab*', re.IGNORECASE)

The RE is passed to re.compile() as a string. REs are handled as strings because regular expressions aren’t part of the core Python language, and no special syntax was created for expressing them. (There are applications that don’t need REs at all, so there’s no need to bloat the language specification by including them.) Instead, the re module is simply a C extension module included with Python, just like the socket or zlib modules.

Putting REs in strings keeps the Python language simpler, but has one disadvantage which is the topic of the next section.

The Backslash Plague
--------------------
As stated earlier, regular expressions use the backslash character ('\') to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This conflicts with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals.

Let’s say you want to write a RE that matches the string \section, which might be found in a LaTeX file. To figure out what to write in the program code, start with the desired string to be matched. Next, you must escape any backslashes and other metacharacters by preceding them with a backslash, resulting in the string \\section. The resulting string that must be passed to re.compile() must be \\section. However, to express this as a Python string literal, both backslashes must be escaped again.
Characters                  Stage
\section                Text string to be matched
\\section               Escaped backslash for re.compile()
"\\\\section"           Escaped backslashes for a string literal

In short, to match a literal backslash, one has to write '\\\\' as the RE string, because the regular expression must be \\, and each backslash must be expressed as \\ inside a regular Python string literal. In REs that feature backslashes repeatedly, this leads to lots of repeated backslashes and makes the resulting strings difficult to understand.

The solution is to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expressions; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with 'r', so r"\n" is a two-character string containing '\' and 'n', while "\n" is a one-character string containing a newline. Regular expressions will often be written in Python code using this raw string notation.

In addition, special escape sequences that are valid in regular expressions, but not valid as Python string literals, now result in a DeprecationWarning and will eventually become a SyntaxError, which means the sequences will be invalid if raw string notation or escaping the backslashes isn’t used.

Regular String              Raw string
"ab*"                       r"ab*"
"\\\\section"               r"\\section"
"\\w+\\s+\\1"               r"\w+\s+\1"

Performing Matches
Once you have an object representing a compiled regular expression, what do you do with it? Pattern objects have several methods and attributes. Only the most significant ones will be covered here; consult the re docs for a complete listing.

Method/Attribute                Purpose
match()                 Determine if the RE matches at the beginning of the string.
search()                Scan through a string, looking for any location where this RE matches.
findall()               Find all substrings where the RE matches, and returns them as a list.
finditer()              Find all substrings where the RE matches, and returns them as an iterator.

match() and search() return None if no match can be found. If they’re successful, a match object instance is returned, containing information about the match: where it starts and ends, the substring it matched, and more.

First, run the Python interpreter, import the re module, and compile a RE:
p = re.compile('[a-z]+')
p ####### re.compile(r'[a-z]+', re.UNICODE)

Now, you can try matching various strings against the RE [a-z]+. An empty string shouldn’t match at all, since + means ‘one or more repetitions’. match() should return None in this case, which will cause the interpreter to print no output. You can explicitly print the result of match() to make this clear.
p.match("") ## No output
print(p.match("")) # None

Now, let’s try it on a string that it should match, such as tempo. In this case, match() will return a match object, so you should store the result in a variable for later use.

p = re.compile('[a-t]+')
m = p.match("temupau")
print(m) # <re.Match object; span=(0, 3), match='tem'>

Now you can query the match object for information about the matching string. Match object instances also have several methods and attributes; the most important ones are:

Method/Attribute                Purpose
group()                 Return the string matched by the RE
start()                 Return the starting position of the match
end()                   Return the ending position of the match
span()                  Return a tuple containing the (start, end) positions of the match

m.group() # 'tem'
m.start() # 0
m.end()   # 3
m.span()  # (0, 3)

group() returns the substring that was matched by the RE. start() and end() return the starting and ending index of the match. span() returns both start and end indexes in a single tuple. Since the match() method only checks if the RE matches at the start of a string, start() will always be zero. However, the search() method of patterns scans through the string, so the match may not start at zero in that case
print(p.match('::: message')) # None
m = p.search('::: message'); print(m) #<re.Match object; span=(4, 11), match='message'>
m.group() #'message'
m.start() # 4
m.end() # 11
m.span() # (4, 11)

In actual programs, the most common style is to store the match object in a variable, and then check if it was None. This usually looks like:
p = re.compile(r'[a-r]+')
m = p.match('ramesh tau')
if m:
    print('Matched', m.group())
else:
    print('No Match')
## Output - Matched rame

Two pattern methods return all of the matches for a pattern. findall() returns a list of matching strings:
p.findall('12 drummers drumming, 11 pipers piping, 10 lords a-leaping')
p = re.compile(r'\d+')
p.findall('12 drummers drumming, 11 pipers piping, 10 lords a-leaping')

The r prefix, making the literal a raw string literal, is needed in this example because escape sequences in a normal “cooked” string literal that are not recognized by Python, as opposed to regular expressions, now result in a DeprecationWarning and will eventually become a SyntaxError. See The Backslash Plague.

findall() has to create the entire list before it can be returned as the result. The finditer() method returns a sequence of match object instances as an iterator:
p = re.compile(r'\d+')
iterator = p.finditer('12 drummers drumming, 11 pipers piping, 10 lords a-leaping')
for match in iterator:
    print(match.group())
    print(match.start())
    print(match.end())
    print(match.span())

-------------------------------Learning Till now:------------------------------------------------
Meta Characters -->  . ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )
. -> any number of chars except \n, re.DOTALL is another option which includes \n as well
^ -> except
$ ->
* -> 0 to infinite matches
+ -> 1 to infinite matches
? -> 0 or 1 match
{} -> {m,n} -- There must be atleast m repetitions and atmost n repetitions
[] -> char class, can have values inside it like [a-zA-Z], meta chars are not active inside char class mean + will be char + and not meta char inside char class
\  -> escape character
|  ->
() ->

Predefined char classes:
\d - digits - equivalent to char class [0-9]
\D - except digits [0-9]
\s - white space chars [ \t\n\r\f\v]
\S - except white space chars [^ \t\n\r\f\v]
\w - alphanumeric [a-zA-Z0-9_]
\W - except alphanumeric [^a-zA-Z0-9_]

Regex in python:
1. compile a string object to get a pattern object.
2. Apply regex methods on pattern object.

why is raw string required to be passed to compile method like re.compile(r'+\d\) and regular string not enough?
Because of backslash plague, to search for a string having backslash '\string' it has to be converted to '\\string' to be passed to compile method to get a Pattern object and '\\\\string' to be passed as a string so it is better to pass it as a raw string r'\string' this will let interpreter know that backslash is a string char.
This is helpful for predefined char classes as well.

How to compile a RE?
re.compile(r'[a-z]')
re.compile(r'\d+')

methods which can be applied on pattern object.
match() - returns matched object if string matched from starting else None
search() - returns matched object if substring is present anywhere in teh string
findall() - finds all elements of the RE and returns it in the form of list
finditer() - returns an iterator object which can be iterated using for loop

methods which can be applied over matched objects.
group() - returns the matched string.
start() - returns starting index of the matched string.
end() - returns end index of the matched string.
span() - returns a tuple with start and end index of the matched string.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Module-Level Functions
-----------------------
You don’t have to create a pattern object and call its methods; the re module also provides top-level functions called match(), search(), findall(), sub(), and so forth. These functions take the same arguments as the corresponding pattern method with the RE string added as the first argument, and still return either None or a match object instance.

print(re.match(r'From\s+', 'Fromage amk')) # None
print(re.match(r'From\s+', 'From 7 till 10')) # <re.Match object; span=(0, 5), match='From '>

Under the hood, these functions simply create a pattern object for you and call the appropriate method on it. They also store the compiled object in a cache, so future calls using the same RE won’t need to parse the pattern again and again.

Should you use these module-level functions, or should you get the pattern and call its methods yourself? If you’re accessing a regex within a loop, pre-compiling it will save a few function calls. Outside of loops, there’s not much difference thanks to the internal cache.

Compilation Flags
Compilation flags let you modify some aspects of how regular expressions work. Flags are available in the re module under two names, a long name such as IGNORECASE and a short, one-letter form such as I. (If you’re familiar with Perl’s pattern modifiers, the one-letter forms use the same letters; the short form of re.VERBOSE is re.X, for example.) Multiple flags can be specified by bitwise OR-ing them; re.I | re.M sets both the I and M flags, for example.

Here’s a table of the available flags, followed by a more detailed explanation of each one.

Flag                                        Meaning
ASCII, A    Makes several escapes like \w, \b, \s and \d match only on ASCII characters with the respective property.
DOTALL, S                               Make . match any character, including newlines.
IGNORECASE, I                           Do case-insensitive matches.
LOCALE, L                               Do a locale-aware match.
MULTILINE, M                            Multi-line matching, affecting ^ and $.
VERBOSE, X (for ‘extended’)             Enable verbose REs, which can be organized more cleanly and understandably.

I IGNORECASE --> Perform case-insensitive matching; character class and literal strings will match letters by ignoring case. For example, [A-Z] will match lowercase letters, too.
L LOCALE  --> Make \w, \W, \b, \B and case-insensitive matching dependent on the current locale instead of the Unicode database.
M MULTILINE --> (^ and $ haven’t been explained yet; they’ll be introduced in section More Metacharacters.)
Usually ^ matches only at the beginning of the string, and $ matches only at the end of the string and immediately before the newline (if any) at the end of the string.
S DOTALL --> Makes the '.' special character match any character at all, including a newline; without this flag, '.' will match anything except a newline.
A ASCII --> Make \w, \W, \b, \B, \s and \S perform ASCII-only matching instead of full Unicode matching. This is only meaningful for Unicode patterns, and is ignored for byte patterns.
X VERBOSE --> This flag allows you to write regular expressions that are more readable by granting you more flexibility in how you can format them.
For example, here’s a RE that uses re.VERBOSE; see how much easier it is to read?
charref = re.compile(r"""
 &[#]                # Start of a numeric entity reference
 (
     0[0-7]+         # Octal form
   | [0-9]+          # Decimal form
   | x[0-9a-fA-F]+   # Hexadecimal form
 )
 ;                   # Trailing semicolon
""", re.VERBOSE)

Without the verbose setting, the RE would look like this:

charref = re.compile("&#(0[0-7]+"
                     "|[0-9]+"
                     "|x[0-9a-fA-F]+);")

In the above example, Python’s automatic concatenation of string literals has been used to break up the RE into smaller pieces, but it’s still more difficult to understand than the version using re.VERBOSE.

More Pattern Power
So far we’ve only covered a part of the features of regular expressions. In this section, we’ll cover some new metacharacters, and how to use groups to retrieve portions of the text that was matched.

More Metacharacters
There are some metacharacters that we haven’t covered yet. Most of them will be covered in this section.

| --> Alternation, or the “or” operator. If A and B are regular expressions, A|B will match any string that matches either A or B. | has very low precedence in order to make it work reasonably when you’re alternating multi-character strings. Crow|Servo will match either 'Crow' or 'Servo', not 'Cro', a 'w' or an 'S', and 'ervo'.
To match a literal '|', use \|, or enclose it inside a character class, as in [|].

^ --> Matches at the beginning of lines. Unless the MULTILINE flag has been set, this will only match at the beginning of the string. In MULTILINE mode, this also matches immediately after each newline within the string.
For example, if you wish to match the word From only at the beginning of a line, the RE to use is ^From.

print(re.search(r'^From', 'From here to eternity')) # <re.Match object; span=(0, 4), match='From'>
print(re.search(r'^From', 'Reciting From Memory')) # None

To match a literal '^', use \^.

$ --> Matches at the end of a line, which is defined as either the end of the string, or any location followed by a newline character.
>>> print(re.search('}$', '{block}'))   # <re.Match object; span=(6, 7), match='}'>
>>> print(re.search('}$', '{block} '))  # None
>>> print(re.search('}$', '{block}\n')) # <re.Match object; span=(6, 7), match='}'>
To match a literal '$', use \$ or enclose it inside a character class, as in [$].

\A --> Matches only at the start of the string. When not in MULTILINE mode, \A and ^ are effectively the same. In MULTILINE mode, they’re different: \A still matches only at the beginning of the string, but ^ may match at any location inside the string that follows a newline character.

\Z --> Matches only at the end of the string.

\b --> Word boundary. This is a zero-width assertion that matches only at the beginning or end of a word. A word is defined as a sequence of alphanumeric characters, so the end of a word is indicated by whitespace or a non-alphanumeric character.
The following example matches class only when it’s a complete word; it won’t match when it’s contained inside another word.
p = re.compile(r'\bclass\b')
print(p.search('This is my class')) # <re.Match object; span=(11, 16), match='class'>
print(p.search('THis is declassified')) # None
print(p.search('One subclass at a time')) # None

There are two subtleties you should remember when using this special sequence. First, this is the worst collision between Python’s string literals and regular expression sequences. In Python’s string literals, \b is the backspace character, ASCII value 8. If you’re not using raw strings, then Python will convert the \b to a backspace, and your RE won’t match as you expect it to. The following example looks the same as our previous RE, but omits the 'r' in front of the RE string.
p = re.compile('\bclass\b')
print(p.search('This is my class')) # None
print(p.search('THis is declassified')) # None
print(p.search('One subclass at a time')) # None
print(p.search('\b' + 'class' + '\b')) # <re.Match object; span=(0, 7), match='\x08class\x08'>

Second, inside a character class, where there’s no use for this assertion, \b represents the backspace character, for compatibility with Python’s string literals.

\B --> Another zero-width assertion, this is the opposite of \b, only matching when the current position is not at a word boundary.

Grouping
--------
Frequently you need to obtain more information than just whether the RE matched or not. Regular expressions are often used to dissect strings by writing a RE divided into several subgroups which match different components of interest. For example, an RFC-822 header line is divided into a header name and a value, separated by a ':', like this:
From: author@example.com
User-Agent: Thunderbird 1.5.0.9 (X11/20061227)
This can be handled by writing a regular expression which matches an entire header line, and has one group which matches the header name, and another group which matches the header’s value.

Groups are marked by the '(', ')' metacharacters. '(' and ')' have much the same meaning as they do in mathematical expressions; they group together the expressions contained inside them, and you can repeat the contents of a group with a repeating qualifier, such as *, +, ?, or {m,n}. For example, (ab)* will match zero or more repetitions of ab.

p = re.compile('(ab)*')
print(p.match('ababbbababb').span(1)) # (2, 4)

Groups indicated with '(', ')' also capture the starting and ending index of the text that they match; this can be retrieved by passing an argument to group(), start(), end(), and span(). Groups are numbered starting with 0. Group 0 is always present; it’s the whole RE, so match object methods all have group 0 as their default argument. Later we’ll see how to express groups that don’t capture the span of text that they match.

p = re.compile('(a)b')
print(p.match('ab')) # <re.Match object; span=(0, 2), match='ab'>
m = p.match('ab')
print(m.group(0)) # ab
print(m.group(1)) # a

Subgroups are numbered from left to right, from 1 upward. Groups can be nested; to determine the number, just count the opening parenthesis characters, going from left to right.
p = re.compile('(a(b)c)d')
m = p.match('abcd')
m.group() # 'abcd'
m.group(1) # 'abc'
m.group(2) # b

group() can be passed multiple group numbers at a time, in which case it will return a tuple containing the corresponding values for those groups.
m.group(2,1,2) # ('b', 'abc', 'b')

The groups() method returns a tuple containing the strings for all the subgroups, from 1 up to however many there are.
m.groups() # ('abc', 'b')

Backreferences in a pattern allow you to specify that the contents of an earlier capturing group must also be found at the current location in the string. For example, \1 will succeed if the exact contents of group 1 can be found at the current position, and fails otherwise. Remember that Python’s string literals also use a backslash followed by numbers to allow including arbitrary characters in a string, so be sure to use a raw string when incorporating backreferences in a RE.
For example, the following RE detects doubled words in a string.
p = re.compile(r'\b(\w+)\s+\1\b')
p.search('This is the the Paris').group() # 'the the'

Backreferences like this aren’t often useful for just searching through a string — there are few text formats which repeat data in this way — but you’ll soon find out that they’re very useful when performing string substitutions.

-----------------------Learnings till here-----------------------------------------
Module Level Functions - We can apply methods directly on string without compiling and creating pattern object explicitly. Python creates the pattern object for us and applies methods on it. This pattern object is stored in cache so that each time pattern object is not created internally.
re.match(r'\d+', 'Ramesh 10')

when to use compile and when not to use?
If you are using pattern object in loop, its good to create it once before loop. Otherwise the performance will be almost same as it is stored in cache.

Compilation Flags:
ASCII, A - Makes several escapes like \w, \b, \s and \d match only on ASCII characters with the respective property.
DOTALL, S - Make . match any character, including newlines.
IGNORECASE, I - Do case-insensitive matches.
LOCALE, L - Do a locale-aware match. (Other languages word match)
MULTILINE, M - Multi-line matching, affecting ^ and $.
VERBOSE, X (for ‘extended’) - Enable verbose REs, which can be organized more cleanly and understandably.

More Metacharacters:
| - or condition while matching
^ - beginning of the line, with MULTILINE it will search only beginning of the string.
$ - end of the line
\A - Matches only at the start of the string. When not in MULTILINE mode, \A and ^ are effectively the same.
\Z - Matches only at the end of the string.
\b - word boundary - word between \bword\b is matched.
\B - this is the opposite of \b, only matching when the current position is not at a word boundary.

Grouping:
() - group characters between (). Groups are marked by the '(', ')' metacharacters. '(' and ')' have much the same meaning as they do in mathematical expressions; they group together the expressions contained inside them, and you can repeat the contents of a group with a repeating qualifier, such as *, +, ?, or {m,n}.

groups - groups function returns all the matched group in the form of a tuple.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Non-capturing and Named Groups
-------------------------------
Sometimes you’ll want to use a group to denote a part of a regular expression, but aren’t interested in retrieving the group’s contents. You can make this fact explicit by using a non-capturing group: (?:...), where you can replace the ... with any other regular expression.
m = re.match("([abc])+", "abc")
m.groups() # ('c',)
m = re.match("(?:[abc])+", "abc")
m.groups() # ()

Modifying Strings
-----------------
Up to this point, we’ve simply performed searches against a static string. Regular expressions are also commonly used to modify strings in various ways, using the following pattern methods:
Method/Attribute            Purpose
split()             Split the string into a list, splitting it wherever the RE matches
sub()               Find all substrings where the RE matches, and replace them with a different string
subn()              Does the same thing as sub(), but returns the new string and the number of replacements

Splitting Strings
The split() method of a pattern splits a string apart wherever the RE matches, returning a list of the pieces. It’s similar to the split() method of strings but provides much more generality in the delimiters that you can split by; string split() only supports splitting by whitespace or by a fixed string. As you’d expect, there’s a module-level re.split() function, too.

.split(string[, maxsplit=0])
Split string by the matches of the regular expression. If capturing parentheses are used in the RE, then their contents will also be returned as part of the resulting list. If maxsplit is nonzero, at most maxsplit splits are performed.

You can limit the number of splits made, by passing a value for maxsplit. When maxsplit is nonzero, at most maxsplit splits will be made, and the remainder of the string is returned as the final element of the list. In the following example, the delimiter is any sequence of non-alphanumeric characters.

p = re.compile(r'\W+')
p.split('This is a test, short and sweet, of split().')
p.split('This is a test, short and sweet, of split().', 3)

Sometimes you’re not only interested in what the text between delimiters is, but also need to know what the delimiter was. If capturing parentheses are used in the RE, then their values are also returned as part of the list. Compare the following calls:
p = re.compile(r'\W+')
p2 = re.compile(r'(\W+)')

p.split('This.... is a test.') # ['This', 'is', 'a', 'test', '']
p2.split('This.... is a test.') # ['This', '.... ', 'is', ' ', 'a', ' ', 'test', '.', '']

The module-level function re.split() adds the RE to be used as the first argument, but is otherwise the same.
re.split(r'[\W]+', 'Words, words, words.')
re.split(r'([\W]+)', 'Words, words, words.')
re.split(r'[\W]+', 'Words, words, words.', 1)

Search and Replace
Another common task is to find all the matches for a pattern, and replace them with a different string. The sub() method takes a replacement value, which can be either a string or a function, and the string to be processed.
Another common task is to find all the matches for a pattern, and replace them with a different string. The sub() method takes a replacement value, which can be either a string or a function, and the string to be processed.

.sub(replacement, string[, count=0])
Returns the string obtained by replacing the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences of the RE in string by the replacement replacement. If the pattern isn’t found, string is returned unchanged.

The optional argument count is the maximum number of pattern occurrences to be replaced; count must be a non-negative integer. The default value of 0 means to replace all occurrences.

Here’s a simple example of using the sub() method. It replaces colour names with the word colour:

p = re.compile('(blue|white|red)', re.IGNORECASE)
p.sub('color', 'blue shocks and Red shoes')
p.sub('color', 'blue shocks and Red shoes', count=1) # 'color shocks and Red shoes'

The subn() method does the same work, but returns a 2-tuple containing the new string value and the number of replacements that were performed:
p = re.compile('(blue|white|red)', re.IGNORECASE)
p.subn('color', 'blue and red')
p.subn('color', 'blue and red', count=1)

Empty matches are replaced only when they’re not adjacent to a previous empty match.
p = re.compile('x*')
p.sub('-', 'abxd')

If replacement is a string, any backslash escapes in it are processed. That is, \n is converted to a single newline character, \r is converted to a carriage return, and so forth. Unknown escapes such as \& are left alone. Backreferences, such as \6, are replaced with the substring matched by the corresponding group in the RE. This lets you incorporate portions of the original text in the resulting replacement string.

This example matches the word section followed by a string enclosed in {, }, and changes section to subsection:
p = re.compile('section{ ( [^}]* ) }', re.VERBOSE)
p.sub(r'subsection{\1}','section{First} section{second}')

Use String Methods
before turning to the re module, consider whether your problem can be solved with a faster and simpler string method.

---Learnings---------
RE methods for strings:
split() -
sub('new string', 'complete string', count=) - substitute, can provide the count for number of replacements
subn() - same as sub but returns the modified string and number of replacements

Whereever possible use string methods if string methods have some short comings then go to re module because string methods are optimized for that particular task where re methods are generalized.
