Numpy stands for Numerical Python
NumPy is a numerical library for python that allows for exteremely fast data generation and handling.
It utilizes arrays which can efficiently store data(much better than a built in normal python list)
Understanding numpy is crucial to truly mastering pandas.

Numpy has:
Numpy arrays
Numpy indexing and selection
Numpy operations

Numpy arrays basically comes under two flavors:
1. Vectors - One dimentional arrays
2. matrix - 2 dimention i.e it has one row and one col in numpy. It's a list of list.

Performace wise numpy arrays are far better than list
import numpy as np
#Creating numpy array
l=[1,2,3]
type(np.array(l)) # convert list to a vector

Comparision Example:

import time
l=list(range(50000000))
st = time.time()
for i in l:
    i*2
print(time.time() - st)
n=np.array(l)
st = time.time()
n*2
print(time.time() - st)

Output:
7.179000616073608
0.5665650367736816

np.array(list([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]))

Similar to  range in python, numpy has arange which is used to generate a sequence of numbers.
np.arange(1,10,2)
