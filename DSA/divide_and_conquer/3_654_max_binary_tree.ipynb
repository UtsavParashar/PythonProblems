    "1. What is a Monotonic Stack?\n",
    "A monotonic stack is a stack where the elements are arranged in a specific order:\n",
    "In this case, the stack will maintain elements in decreasing order of their values.\n",

    "Pop the top element from the stack.\n",
    "Make it the left child of the current node (current.left = stack.pop()).\n",
    "Why? Because in a Maximum Binary Tree, the left child of a node is the largest number to its left, and popping smaller elements ensures this property.\n",
    "Set the Right Child:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the stack is not empty after popping, the current node becomes the right child of the top element in the stack (stack[-1].right = current).\n",
    "Why? Because the top element in the stack is the largest number encountered so far, and the current number is the next larger number, so it must be its right child.\n",
