    "We use two pointers:\n",
    "\n",
    "i is the slow pointer: tracks the position of the last unique element.\n",
    "\n",
    "j is the fast pointer: scans the array for the next new unique number.\n",

    "Whenever nums[j] != nums[i], we know we found a new unique element.\n",

    "Why it‚Äôs efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "How it meets in-place and O(1) space requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "A clear walkthrough using an example\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Explanation to the Interviewer:\n",
    "Since the array is sorted, all duplicate elements will appear next to each other. So, we can use a two-pointer approach to overwrite duplicates with unique elements in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use one pointer i to keep track of the last unique element‚Äôs index.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second pointer j iterates through the array from index 1 onward.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I find a new value nums[j] that is not equal to nums[i], it means we've found a new unique element.\n",
    "\n",
    "I move i one step forward and replace nums[i] with nums[j] to keep all unique elements at the beginning of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I return i + 1, which gives the count of unique elements in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "This satisfies both the in-place requirement and the O(1) extra space constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "üîç Example to Demonstrate:\n",
    "Let‚Äôs say the input is:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3]\n",
    "i = 0, j = 1 ‚Üí 6\n",
    "\n",
    "At j = 2, nums[2] != nums[0], so I increment i and write nums[2] to nums[1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeating this, I shift unique values to the front.\n",
    "\n",
    "End result: nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, _, _, _], return 4\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† Why this is Efficient:\n",
    "Time complexity: O(n), each element is visited once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity: O(1), no extra space used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In-place: It modifies the input array without allocating another.\n",
    "\n",
    "üó£ Key Points to Emphasize:\n",
    "It works only because the array is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic ensures that all unique elements are preserved at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any values after the returned length are irrelevant."

    "## Follow Up Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "üîπ 1. Q: Why does this solution only work on sorted arrays?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "The logic relies on the fact that duplicates are adjacent in a sorted array. This allows us to detect duplicates with a simple comparison between nums[j] and nums[i].\n",
    "If the array were unsorted, duplicates could be anywhere, and this linear scan wouldn't detect them correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the array was unsorted, we'd need a set to track seen elements, which violates the O(1) space constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "üîπ 2. Q: Can you modify this solution to remove duplicates from an unsorted array in-place?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "Yes, but not with O(1) space. To handle unsorted arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd use a set to track seen elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a write pointer to overwrite the array in-place with only unique values.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this approach would need O(n) extra space.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "def remove_duplicates_unsorted(nums):\n",
    "    seen = set()\n",
    "    write = 0\n",
    "    for read in range(len(nums)):\n",
    "        if nums[read] not in seen:\n",
    "            seen.add(nums[read])\n",
    "            nums[write] = nums[read]\n",
    "            write += 1\n",
    "    return write\n",
    "üîπ 3. Q: What is the time and space complexity of your original solution? Why?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array. Each element is processed once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(1), no extra data structures are used ‚Äî all operations are in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "üîπ 4. Q: What does \"in-place\" mean in the context of this problem?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "\"In-place\" means modifying the original array without using extra memory proportional to the input size. We can use a constant amount of additional variables, but we should not create a new array to store the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "üîπ 5. Q: What happens to the remaining elements after the new length?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "They're left unchanged or contain leftover values, but they're considered irrelevant.\n",
    "The problem only asks us to return the new length, and values beyond that length are ignored by the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "If needed, we could set them to a placeholder like None or _, but that's not required by the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "üîπ 6. Q: Can you implement this using recursion instead of a loop?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "Yes, but recursion is not ideal here. It would increase the call stack and not be as space-efficient. Also, Python has a recursion limit, so for large inputs this may fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recursive version would resemble:\n",

    "        nums[i] = nums[j]\n",
    "    return remove_duplicates_recursive(nums, i, j + 1)\n",
    "üîπ 7. Q: Could you generalize this solution to allow at most k duplicates instead of 1?\n",
