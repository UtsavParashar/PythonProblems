    "Here’s how you can confidently and clearly explain the solution to Leetcode 518 (Coin Change II) to an interviewer:\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 1. Problem Understanding\n",
    "“We are given an array of coin denominations and a total amount. We need to find how many combinations of coins can make up that amount.\n",
    "Each coin can be used unlimited times, and order doesn’t matter (so [1,2] and [2,1] are considered the same).”\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 2. Approach Overview: Dynamic Programming (1D Bottom-Up)\n",
    "“This is a classic unbounded knapsack problem.\n",
    "We’ll use a 1D DP array, where dp[i] represents the number of combinations to make amount i.\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialize dp[0] = 1 since there's exactly 1 way to make amount 0 — by using no coins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for each coin, we iterate through all amounts from that coin value up to the target amount.\n",
    "We update dp[x] += dp[x - coin], meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "We add the number of ways to make x - coin to the ways of making x, because we can use coin once more to reach x.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures we count combinations without duplication and in correct order.”\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 3. Code Explanation\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "dp = [0] * (amount + 1)\n",
    "dp[0] = 1\n",
    "Start with 1 way to make amount 0. All others are 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "for coin in coins:\n",
    "    for x in range(coin, amount + 1):\n",
    "        dp[x] += dp[x - coin]\n",
    "For each coin, we only look forward (not backward), so combinations are built without duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 4. Why this avoids duplicates\n",
    "“We loop through coins first, then the amounts.\n",
    "That means [1,2] and [2,1] are treated the same — only the coin order matters for counting combinations correctly.\n",
    "If we reversed the loop (amount outer, coin inner), we’d count permutations, not combinations.”\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 5. Time and Space Complexity\n",
    "Time: O(N × amount), where N is the number of coins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space: O(amount) for the DP array.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 6. Example Walkthrough\n",
    "If coins = [1, 2, 5] and amount = 5,\n",
    "We’ll build up the combinations step-by-step using DP. Final answer is 4, representing:\n",
