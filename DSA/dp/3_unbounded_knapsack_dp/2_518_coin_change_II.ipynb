    "\n",
    "üîπ 1. Problem Understanding\n",
    "‚ÄúWe are given an array of coin denominations and a total amount. We need to find how many combinations of coins can make up that amount.\n",
    "Each coin can be used unlimited times, and order doesn‚Äôt matter (so [1,2] and [2,1] are considered the same).‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "üîπ 2. Approach Overview: Dynamic Programming (1D Bottom-Up)\n",
    "‚ÄúThis is a classic unbounded knapsack problem.\n",
    "We‚Äôll use a 1D DP array, where dp[i] represents the number of combinations to make amount i.\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialize dp[0] = 1 since there's exactly 1 way to make amount 0 ‚Äî by using no coins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for each coin, we iterate through all amounts from that coin value up to the target amount.\n",
    "We update dp[x] += dp[x - coin], meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "We add the number of ways to make x - coin to the ways of making x, because we can use coin once more to reach x.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures we count combinations without duplication and in correct order.‚Äù\n",

    "üîπ 3. Code Explanation\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "dp = [0] * (amount + 1)\n",
    "dp[0] = 1\n",
    "Start with 1 way to make amount 0. All others are 0.\n",

    "Edit\n",
    "for coin in coins:\n",
    "    for x in range(coin, amount + 1):\n",
    "        dp[x] += dp[x - coin]\n",
    "For each coin, we only look forward (not backward), so combinations are built without duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "üîπ 4. Why this avoids duplicates\n",
    "‚ÄúWe loop through coins first, then the amounts.\n",
    "That means [1,2] and [2,1] are treated the same ‚Äî only the coin order matters for counting combinations correctly.\n",
    "If we reversed the loop (amount outer, coin inner), we‚Äôd count permutations, not combinations.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "üîπ 5. Time and Space Complexity\n",
    "Time: O(N √ó amount), where N is the number of coins.\n",
