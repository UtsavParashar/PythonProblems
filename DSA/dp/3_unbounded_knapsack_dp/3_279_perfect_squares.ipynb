    "\n",
    "🔍 Why range(1, int(math.isqrt(i)) + 1)?\n",
    "A perfect square is of the form j² (e.g., 1²=1, 2²=4, 3²=9, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "To find all perfect squares less than or equal to i, we only need to try all j such that:\n",

    "i\n",
    "​\n",
    " \n",
    "So, we loop from j = 1 up to j = int(√i) — and add +1 because Python's range() is exclusive at the upper bound.\n",

    "✅ Example:\n",

    "\n",
    "1² = 1\n",

    "In leetcode 322, the outer loop iterates over coins and the inner loop iterates over the dp array. However, in the solution of leetcode 279 the outer loop iterates over the range 1 to n+1 and the inner loop iterates over the range of 1 to int(math.isqrt(i)) + 1\n",

    "🔁 Loop Order Difference\n",
    "🪙 Leetcode 322 – Coin Change:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "for coin in coins:\n",
    "    for amount in range(coin, amount + 1):\n",

    "Outer loop: over each coin denomination\n",
    "\n",
    "Inner loop: over the amounts from coin to amount\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Because we want unlimited supply of each coin (i.e., we can use the same coin multiple times), so we fix the coin and build the answer using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧮 Leetcode 279 – Perfect Squares:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "for i in range(1, n + 1):\n",
    "    for j in range(1, int(math.isqrt(i)) + 1):\n",

    "Outer loop: over each i from 1 to n\n",
    "\n",
    "Inner loop: over perfect square values ≤ i\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Because we are building the solution for each number step by step, using smaller perfect square numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "🤔 Why the Loop Order Is Different\n",
    "✅ In Leetcode 322:\n",
    "The coins are input.\n",
    "\n",
    "You iterate over coins first to reuse them across all amounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful if you want to reuse coins infinitely (classic unbounded knapsack).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as: “For each coin, see how it can contribute to different totals.”\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ In Leetcode 279:\n",
    "The perfect squares are not input, they are derived from n.\n",
    "\n",
    "You iterate over all numbers from 1 to n because you're computing the minimum count of perfect squares to reach each number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inner loop generates all usable squares at that stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as: “For this number i, try subtracting each perfect square ≤ i.”\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Analogy\n",
    "Problem\tOuter Loop\tInner Loop\tReason\n",
    "Leetcode 322\tCoins\tAmounts\tFix coin, try building sums\n",
    "Leetcode 279\tAmount i\tSquares ≤ i\tFix target, try breaking it\n",
    "\n",
    "🧪 Could We Swap the Loops in Leetcode 279?\n",
    "Yes — you could write Leetcode 279 like Coin Change:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "squares = [i*i for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1)]\n",
    "\n",
    "for square in squares:\n",
    "    for i in range(square, n + 1):\n",
    "        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - square] + 1)\n",
    "This is perfectly valid and equally optimal. It mirrors Leetcode 322 in structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Both versions are correct.\n",
    "First version: for each number, try subtracting squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second version: for each square, see how it builds up to n.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔚 Conclusion:\n",
    "Both Leetcode 279 and 322 are unbounded knapsack problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop order reflects how you prefer to build the solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fix items → build target? → for coin/square in items\n",
    "\n",
    "Fix targets → try combinations? → for i in range(1, n + 1)\n",

    "ChatGPT said:\n",
    "Great follow-up!\n",
    "\n",
    "In Leetcode 279 (Perfect Squares), both loops start from 1 instead of 0 — and that’s intentional and necessary.\n",

    "\n",
    "🔁 The Outer Loop: for i in range(1, n + 1)\n",
    "🔹 Why not from 0?\n",
    "We're trying to compute the minimum number of perfect squares that sum to i, for all i from 1 to n.\n",

    "dp = [0] + [float('inf')] * n\n",
    "This means: it takes 0 squares to sum to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from i = 1 makes sense, because we want to build dp[1], dp[2], ..., dp[n].\n",
    "\n",
    "If we started from 0, we’d be redundantly updating dp[0], which already has the correct value (0). There’s no meaningful smaller subproblem than 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔁 The Inner Loop: for j in range(1, int(math.isqrt(i)) + 1)\n",
    "🔹 Why not from 0?\n",
    "We’re iterating over j to generate perfect squares j² such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "𝑗\n",
    "2\n",
    "≤\n",
    "𝑖\n",
    "j \n",
    "2\n",
    " ≤i\n",
    "If we start from j = 0, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "j*j = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to no progress in the recurrence:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",

    "Edit\n",
    "dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - j*j] + 1)\n",
    "       = min(dp[i], dp[i - 0] + 1)\n",
    "       = min(dp[i], dp[i] + 1)  ❌\n",
    "This does not improve dp[i], and worse, it could lead to infinite loops or incorrect logic in other implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, from a real-world perspective:\n",
    "\n",
    "0 is not a positive square number.\n",
    "\n",

    "i (target value)\t1\tWe already set dp[0] = 0, and want to build dp[1..n].\n",
    "j (square root)\t1\t0² = 0 leads to dp[i] = dp[i] + 1, which doesn't help and is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you’d like a dry run showing how this would fail with j = 0."
