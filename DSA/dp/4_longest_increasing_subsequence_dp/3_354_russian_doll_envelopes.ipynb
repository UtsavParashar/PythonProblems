    "Why does sorting in ascending and descending order work\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT said:\n",
    "Great question ‚Äî understanding why we sort widths in ascending and heights in descending order (when widths are equal) is key to solving Leetcode 354 optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "üéØ Goal Recap:\n",
    "We want to nest envelopes ‚Äî one inside another ‚Äî where both width and height must be strictly increasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if multiple envelopes have the same width, they cannot be nested, because width is not strictly increasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† Why We Sort:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "envelopes.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sort widths in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "If widths are equal, sort heights in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ What This Achieves:\n",
    "Case without descending sort:\n",
    "If we sorted both width and height in ascending order:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "[(5,4), (5,5), (5,6)]\n",
    "These heights would be [4,5,6], and your LIS would be of length 3 ‚Äî which is wrong because you cannot nest any of them (widths are same).\n",
    "\n",
    "With descending sort:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "[(5,6), (5,5), (5,4)]\n",
    "Now, when we extract heights, we get [6,5,4] ‚Äî a non-increasing sequence, so only one envelope gets counted in the LIS (correct behavior).\n",
    "\n",
    "üéØ The Insight:\n",
    "Sorting heights in descending order when widths are equal prevents same-width envelopes from being nested via LIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "This effectively eliminates duplicates in width and makes LIS work on a 1D problem (heights) assuming widths are already strictly increasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "üì¶ Visual:\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",

    "        w=2    w=5   w=6\n",
