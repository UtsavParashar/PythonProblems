    "Why count of I is assigned count of j in one condition and count of j is added to count of I and assigned to count of I in another condition and why sum c in the last statement \n",

    "We are computing for each i:\n",
    "\n",
    "length[i]: length of longest increasing subsequence (LIS) ending at i\n",
    "\n",
    "count[i]: number of such LIS ending at i\n",

    "→ This means we found a longer LIS ending at i.\n",

    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is the longest LIS found so far at i.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we replace the current count[i] with count[j] — all such LIS came through j.\n",

    "If now another j leads to same length[j] + 1 == 3, and count[j] = 1\n",
