    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¹1. Understanding the Problem\n",
    "We are given a string s, and we need to find the longest palindromic substring within it. A palindrome reads the same forward and backward, like \"aba\" or \"bb\".\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¹2. High-Level Idea\n",
    "A palindrome mirrors around its center. So, for each character (or between characters), we can expand outward to find the longest palindrome centered there.\n",
    "Since there are 2n - 1 possible centers (n single characters and n-1 pairs between characters), we iterate over all of them and track the longest one.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¹3. Implementation Strategy\n",
    "I define a helper function expand_around_center(left, right) that expands outwards while the characters match.\n",
    "\n",
    "For every index i in the string:\n",
    "\n",
    "I expand around center i for odd-length palindromes (like \"aba\").\n",
    "\n",
    "I expand around center i and i+1 for even-length palindromes (like \"abba\").\n",
    "\n",
    "I keep updating the result if a longer palindrome is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¹4. Why It's Efficient\n",
    "Time complexity is O(nÂ²) in the worst case, which is acceptable for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity is O(1) since we only use variables â€” no extra memory like a DP table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much simpler and faster in practice compared to the dynamic programming solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¹5. Example Walkthrough\n",
    "Letâ€™s say the input is \"babad\":\n",
    "\n",
    "At i = 1, expanding around \"a\" gives us \"bab\"\n",
    "\n",
    "At i = 2, expanding around \"b\" gives us \"aba\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We track and return the longest one found â€” either \"bab\" or \"aba\"\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¹6. Closing Summary\n",
    "By expanding around each center, we avoid redundant computations and reduce space usage. It gives us a clean and optimized way to solve the problem in O(nÂ²) time and O(1) space, with clear logic and simple implementation."

    "## Follow up questions\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¸1. What is the time and space complexity of your solution? Why?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)\n",
    "Because for each of the n positions, we may expand up to O(n) characters while checking for palindromes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(1)\n",
    "We're only using a few variables and not any additional data structures like DP tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¸2. Why do we consider both even and odd length palindromes?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Because a palindrome can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "Odd-length: e.g., \"racecar\" â†’ center is a single character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even-length: e.g., \"abba\" â†’ center is between two characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle both, we must check:\n",
    "\n",
    "expand_around_center(i, i) â†’ odd-length\n",
    "\n",
    "expand_around_center(i, i+1) â†’ even-length\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¸3. Can you modify this solution to return the start and end indices of the palindrome instead of the substring itself?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Yes. Instead of returning the substring in expand_around_center, we can return the (start, end) indices. We can then use those to extract the substring at the end:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "start, end = 0, 0\n",
    "for i in range(len(s)):\n",
    "    l1, r1 = expand_around_center(i, i)\n",
    "    l2, r2 = expand_around_center(i, i+1)\n",
    "    if r1 - l1 > end - start:\n",
    "        start, end = l1, r1\n",
    "    if r2 - l2 > end - start:\n",
    "        start, end = l2, r2\n",
    "return s[start:end+1]\n",
    "ðŸ”¸4. What are some edge cases you'd test this solution on?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Empty string â†’ \"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Single character â†’ \"a\"\n",
    "\n",
    "All characters same â†’ \"aaaa\" â†’ should return the whole string\n",
    "\n",
    "No repeating characters â†’ \"abc\" â†’ should return any single character\n",
    "\n",
    "Long palindrome in the middle â†’ \"abcbade\" â†’ should return \"abcba\"\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¸5. How does this compare to the dynamic programming (DP) solution? When would you prefer one over the other?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "DP Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time: O(nÂ²)\n",
    "\n",
    "Space: O(nÂ²) (2D table)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suitable when you need to track all palindromic substrings, not just the longest one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expand Around Center:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time: O(nÂ²)\n",
    "\n",
    "Space: O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Much simpler and cleaner for just finding the longest palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd prefer Expand Around Center unless I have a reason to store all palindromic substrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¸6. Can you optimize this further to better than O(nÂ²)?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Yes, there is an algorithm called Manacherâ€™s Algorithm that solves the problem in O(n) time. Itâ€™s more complex and involves transforming the string to handle both even and odd length palindromes uniformly. But it's rarely asked unless the focus is on algorithmic optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¸7. What happens if the string contains Unicode characters or mixed cases?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The algorithm works the same, but:\n",
    "\n",
    "For case-insensitive comparison, we should convert the string to lowercase first: s = s.lower()\n",
    "\n",
    "For Unicode normalization, use unicodedata.normalize() if required."
