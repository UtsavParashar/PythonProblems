    "There are n people in a line queuing to buy tickets, where the 0th person is at the front of the line and the (n - 1)th person is at the back of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a 0-indexed integer array tickets of length n where the number of tickets that the ith person would like to buy is tickets[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "Each person takes exactly 1 second to buy a ticket. A person can only buy 1 ticket at a time and has to go back to the end of the line (which happens instantaneously) in order to buy more tickets. If a person does not have any tickets left to buy, the person will leave the line.\n",
