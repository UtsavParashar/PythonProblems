    "🔁 Why Do We Need a while Loop in highestRated?\n",
    "Yes, heapq ensures the top of the heap contains the food with the highest rating (since we use (-rating, food) for max-heap behavior).\n",
    "BUT, when we do a changeRating, we don’t remove the old value from the heap (heapq has no O(log n) remove), so we push a new entry and leave the old one behind — this is called lazy deletion.\n",

    "Top of the heap is still (-20, 'sushi'), but now this entry is outdated — current rating is 15.\n",
