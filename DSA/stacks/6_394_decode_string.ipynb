    "#### Follow up questions by an Interviewer\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† 1. How does your solution handle nested brackets? Can you walk through a deep nesting example like 2[a2[b2[c]]]?\n",
    "Expected Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The stack naturally handles nested brackets using LIFO (last in, first out). Every time we see [, we push the current string and number onto the stack. As we encounter ], we pop and build up from the innermost string outward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2[a2[b2[c]]] unfolds like:\n",
    "2[c] ‚Üí cc,\n",
    "b + cc ‚Üí bcc, then 2[bcc] ‚Üí bccbcc,\n",
    "a + bccbcc ‚Üí abccbcc, then 2[abccbcc] ‚Üí abccbccabccbcc.\n",
    "\n",
    "üî¢ 2. How would you handle multi-digit numbers like 12[ab]? Would your code still work?\n",
    "Expected Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it works correctly because we accumulate digits like this:\n",
    "curr_num = curr_num * 10 + int(char)\n",
    "This ensures multi-digit numbers like 12 are handled by shifting the digits left and adding the current digit, similar to base-10 arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "üêû 3. What if the input string is malformed (e.g., missing closing bracket or invalid characters)? How would you handle errors?\n",
    "Expected Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The current implementation assumes valid input as per the problem constraints.\n",
    "However, in production, we can add checks such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Raising a ValueError if the stack is not empty at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validating that for every [ there's a corresponding ].\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring numbers precede [ and that brackets are properly nested.\n",
    "\n",
    "üßµ 4. Could this be done recursively instead of iteratively? What would the recursive approach look like?\n",
    "Expected Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we can use recursion by treating each [...] block as a subproblem. We'd define a helper function that processes a substring and returns the decoded string and the index where it ends.\n",
    "Here‚Äôs a sketch:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "def decode(index):\n",
    "    curr_str, num = \"\", 0\n",
    "    while index < len(s):\n",
    "        if s[index].isdigit():\n",
    "            num = num * 10 + int(s[index])\n",
    "        elif s[index] == '[':\n",
    "            substr, index = decode(index + 1)\n",
    "            curr_str += num * substr\n",
    "            num = 0\n",
    "        elif s[index] == ']':\n",
    "            return curr_str, index\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            curr_str += s[index]\n",
    "        index += 1\n",
    "    return curr_str, index\n",
    "üß† 5. Could you extend this to support variables or expressions like x=2; x[ab]?\n",
    "Expected Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Not with the current code. We'd need a preprocessing step to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parse and store variables in a dictionary (e.g., x = 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace x[...] with 2[...] before decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "This moves us toward writing a mini interpreter or parser, similar to how compilers handle expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "üí¨ 6. What's the time and space complexity in the worst case? Could it be improved further?\n",
    "Expected Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time: O(n), since each character is visited once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space: O(n), used for the stack and result string.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can‚Äôt do better than O(n) time due to the need to read every character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space can only be improved if we could decode in-place, which isn't feasible due to the nested nature of input.\n",
    "\n",
    "ü§î 7. How would your solution handle unicode or non-ASCII characters in the encoded string?\n",
    "Expected Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the solution processes characters generically, it handles unicode just like ASCII. For example, 2[üî•] would decode to üî•üî•. No changes are needed unless the encoding uses unusual brackets or digits, in which case preprocessing would be required.\n",
