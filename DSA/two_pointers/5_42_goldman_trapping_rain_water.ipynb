    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Approach: Two-Pointer Technique (Optimized Solution)\n",
    "We use a two-pointer approach with constant space and linear time complexity, which is more efficient than the brute-force or prefix-suffix array method.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔧 Key Variables:\n",
    "l, r: Two pointers starting from left and right ends of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "lmax, rmax: Track the maximum height seen so far from the left and right, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "res: Accumulates the total water trapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Intuition:\n",
    "Water trapped at any index depends on the minimum of the maximum height to its left and right, minus its current height.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of computing these left/right max values repeatedly, we keep track of them dynamically as we move the pointers inward.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step, we move the pointer from the side with the smaller max height.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Because the trapped water depends on the shorter side — we can only trap water up to that level.\n",
    "\n",
    "We compute the trapped water at the new position after moving the pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We update the corresponding max (lmax or rmax) and then add the trapped water: max_so_far - current_height.\n",
    "\n",
    "⏱️ Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "Time: O(n), where n is the number of bars. We traverse the height array only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space: O(1), no extra space used apart from variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Why This Is Optimal:\n",
    "Unlike prefix-suffix methods (which use O(n) extra space), this is a space-efficient solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "It dynamically adapts and updates max heights from both ends without preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 Bonus (If asked):\n",
    "You can mention edge cases you’ve considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "Empty or single-bar arrays return 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Handles cases with no trapped water correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Line:\n",
    "“This solution is both space and time optimal for this problem, using a two-pointer technique that leverages the idea that water trapping depends on the shorter side’s max height. By updating pointers and max heights on the fly, we avoid unnecessary scans or extra arrays.”"

    "## Follow up questions by the interviewer\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 1. Why do we move the pointer with the smaller max height (lmax < rmax) instead of comparing actual heights (height[l] < height[r])?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Because the amount of water trapped at any point is limited by the shorter boundary. The trapped water is calculated as min(lmax, rmax) - height[i].\n",
    "So, whichever side has the smaller maximum (i.e., lower limiting wall), we can confidently say that side is the bottleneck for water, and we process it first to avoid overestimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 2. What does the expression res += lmax - height[l] represent? Can it ever be negative?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "It represents the amount of water trapped at position l, given the current lmax.\n",
    "It can’t be negative because we update lmax as max(lmax, height[l]) before calculating the difference. So, lmax ≥ height[l], ensuring the result is always ≥ 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 3. Why is it necessary to do l += 1 before the computation and not after?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "We want to calculate the water trapped at the next position inside the boundary, not at the boundary itself.\n",
    "Doing l += 1 first ensures we skip the boundary and calculate trapped water at the interior point, which is where trapping happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 4. How does this approach ensure we never double-count any position?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Because we always process one side at a time — either left or right — and only move one pointer at each iteration.\n",
    "This guarantees that each index is processed exactly once, and trapped water is calculated only once at each index.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 5. What is the time and space complexity of this approach? How does it compare to prefix-suffix array method?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity: O(n), as we traverse the array once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity: O(1), as we only use variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prefix-suffix approach uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "O(n) time\n",
    "\n",
    "O(n) space (for left_max[] and right_max[] arrays)\n",
    "\n",
    "So the two-pointer method is more space-efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 6. Is this the most optimal solution possible? Why or why not?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Yes, this is optimal in both time and space. It achieves O(n) time and O(1) space, which is the best you can do for this problem without sacrificing correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 7. What would the output be for input like [], [1], [2,1], or [2,2,2]?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "[] → 0 (empty input)\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] or [2,1] → 0 (no room to trap water)\n",
    "\n",
    "[2,2,2] → 0 (flat surface; no depression to trap water)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are correctly handled since the while loop doesn't run unless l < r.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 8. How would the solution behave if the input is decreasing, like [5,4,3,2,1]?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "No water is trapped in this case, because there is no boundary to the right of any bar that's taller than the current bar.\n",
    "The logic still holds because lmax < rmax never triggers, and r moves all the way to l without accumulating any water.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 9. Can you explain how a stack-based approach to this problem works?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Yes. In the stack-based method:\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a monotonic stack to keep track of indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we find a bar higher than the one on top of the stack, we pop and calculate water trapped with the new top as the left boundary and the current index as the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also results in O(n) time but needs O(n) space for the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 10. How would you solve this using dynamic programming? What trade-offs does it have?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Precompute two arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "left_max[i] = max height to the left of index i (inclusive)\n",
    "\n",
    "right_max[i] = max height to the right of index i (inclusive)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each index i: res += min(left_max[i], right_max[i]) - height[i]\n",
    "\n",
    "Trade-off:\n",
    "\n",
    "Same O(n) time, but needs O(n) extra space, unlike the two-pointer method.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 11. If the bars are very tall (e.g. up to 1e9), would this approach still work?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Yes, as long as the integers don’t overflow. In Python, integers have arbitrary precision, so this is safe. In C++/Java, you’d ensure using long/int64 to prevent overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 12. What if the input comes as a stream — i.e., elevations come in real-time — how would you adapt your solution?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "We can’t use this approach directly since it relies on knowing both ends.\n",
    "In streaming, we might need:\n",
    "\n",
    "A sliding window with partial water estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "Or buffer the input and only compute once we detect a local valley (non-trivial problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a more complex streaming variant and would require approximation or delayed computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 13. Can you modify the solution to return the list of water trapped at each index, not just the total?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Yes. Create a result list water = [0]*n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then instead of res += lmax - height[l], do:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "water[l] = lmax - height[l]\n",
    "Same applies for the r side. Finally, return water.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 14. Could you write a test case where your algorithm would fail if l += 1 was placed after the water computation?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Yes.\n",
    "For height = [4,2,3], if lmax = 4, and we calculate water before incrementing l, we’d wrongly calculate water at index 0 (the boundary), which shouldn't be counted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct approach skips boundaries and computes water only at inner points.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 15. Can you explain the logic using a diagram or dry run?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Yes. Here’s a quick dry run for height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]:\n",
    "\n",
    "ini\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "l = 0, r = 5\n",
    "lmax = 4, rmax = 5 → lmax < rmax → move l\n",
    "l = 1 → height=2 → water = 4-2 = 2\n",
    "l = 2 → height=0 → water = 4-0 = 4\n",
    "l = 3 → height=3 → water = 4-3 = 1\n",
    "l = 4 → height=2 → water = 4-2 = 2\n",
    "l = 5 → loop ends\n",
    "Total = 2+4+1+2 = 9"
