    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”· 1. Start with the problem summary:\n",
    "\"Weâ€™re given an array of integers and asked to find all unique triplets that sum to zero. Each triplet must be in non-descending order, and we must avoid duplicates.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”· 2. Explain the high-level approach:\n",
    "\"I use the two-pointer technique after sorting the array in-place. The sort helps me manage duplicates efficiently and enables a linear-time two-pointer scan to find pairs that, with the current number, sum to zero.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”· 3. Walk through the algorithm step by step:\n",
    "ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Sort the array (in-place)\n",
    "This helps ensure that duplicates are adjacent and allows us to use two pointers efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting is done in-place, so we don't use extra space.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Iterate through the array with index i\n",
    "For each element nums[i], I fix it and then look for two numbers to the right (l and r pointers) such that their sum is -nums[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "I skip duplicates for nums[i] to avoid repeating triplets.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Use two pointers l and r\n",
    "Initialize l = i + 1 and r = len(nums) - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "While l < r:\n",
    "\n",
    "If nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r] == 0, we've found a valid triplet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add it to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Move both l and r to the next different number to avoid duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the sum is too small, increment l.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the sum is too large, decrement r.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”· 4. Explain duplicate handling:\n",
    "_\"Since the array is sorted, I can skip duplicates efficiently:\n",
    "\n",
    "I skip nums[i] if it's equal to nums[i - 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "After finding a valid triplet, I skip repeated nums[l] and nums[r] by comparing to their immediate neighbors.\n",
    "This ensures all triplets are unique without needing extra data structures.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”· 5. State the time and space complexity:\n",
    "Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)\n",
    "\n",
    "Outer loop runs n times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inner two-pointer scan takes O(n) in total across all iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(1) extra space\n",
    "\n",
    "No auxiliary arrays or hash sets used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting is done in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”· 6. Mention edge cases:\n",
    "_\"I also handle edge cases like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays with fewer than 3 elements (nothing to process).\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays with all positives or all negatives (no triplet can sum to 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple duplicate values.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”· 7. Conclude confidently:\n",
    "\"This solution is optimal in terms of both time and space. It avoids brute-force enumeration (which is O(nÂ³)) and handles duplicates cleanly and efficiently.\""

    "## Follow up questions\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¶ 1. Why do we need to sort the array?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Sorting helps in two key ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "It enables the use of the two-pointer technique to reduce time complexity from O(nÂ³) to O(nÂ²).\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows us to skip duplicates efficiently by checking adjacent elements (e.g., nums[i] == nums[i - 1]).\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¶ 2. How do you ensure that you donâ€™t return duplicate triplets?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "I skip duplicates at two places:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the outer loop: If nums[i] == nums[i - 1], we skip to avoid reprocessing the same starting value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the inner loop: After finding a triplet, we skip duplicate values by:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "while l < r and nums[l] == nums[l - 1]: l += 1\n",
    "while l < r and nums[r] == nums[r + 1]: r -= 1\n",
    "ðŸ”¶ 3. Can this be extended to 4Sum or kSum? How?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Yes, 3Sum can be generalized to kSum:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fix one number and reduce the problem to (k-1)Sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, it reduces to 2Sum which can be solved using two pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This recursive approach has time complexity of O(n^(k-1)), assuming sorting is allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¶ 4. What is the time and space complexity?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity: O(nÂ²), due to the outer loop and the inner two-pointer traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(1) extra space, since we sort in-place and donâ€™t use additional data structures (excluding the result list).\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¶ 5. What if the input list is immutable (i.e., cannot be sorted in-place)?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "If sorting the original list is not allowed, we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a copy of the list and sort that: sorted_nums = sorted(nums)\n",
    "\n",
    "Proceed with the same two-pointer logic on sorted_nums.\n",
    "\n",
    "This adds O(n) space overhead, but avoids modifying the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¶ 6. What if you had to return indices instead of values?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "If we need to return the indices of the triplet:\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot sort the original array directly because it scrambles the indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Store the original indices: indexed_nums = list(enumerate(nums))\n",
    "\n",
    "Sort based on values: indexed_nums.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n",
    "\n",
    "Then apply two-pointer logic using indexed_nums[i][1] and track back to their original indexed_nums[i][0].\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¶ 7. Can we use a hash set instead of sorting and two pointers?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Yes, but:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a hash set leads to higher space usage (O(nÂ²) in worst-case).\n",
    "\n",
    "Itâ€™s harder to skip duplicates cleanly.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be more intuitive for beginners but less efficient in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¶ 8. How would you test your solution? What edge cases will you consider?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Some important edge cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Empty array or array with fewer than 3 elements â†’ should return [].\n",
    "\n",
    "Array with all zeros â†’ e.g., [0, 0, 0, 0] â†’ should return [[0, 0, 0]]\n",
    "\n",
    "Array with no valid triplets â†’ e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Array with many duplicates â†’ e.g., [-1, -1, -1, 2, 2, 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¶ 9. What would happen if the array contains very large integers?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The logic remains the same. Python handles large integers automatically with arbitrary precision, but in other languages (like C++ or Java), weâ€™d have to watch for integer overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¶ 10. How would you handle this problem in a streaming context where the full array is not available?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a strict streaming model, 3Sum is non-trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weâ€™d need to maintain a window or some form of summarized state (e.g., hash table of recent values).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's generally not feasible to solve this exactly in a true stream, but approximate solutions or time-windowed versions may be possible."
