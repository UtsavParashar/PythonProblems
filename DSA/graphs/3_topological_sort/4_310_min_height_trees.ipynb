    "Excellent question! The reason why a tree can have at most 2 centroids is based on fundamental properties of trees and graph theory. Let me explain clearly and intuitively:\n",
    "\n",
    "Why at most 2 centroids?\n",

    "A node that, when chosen as the root, results in the minimum possible height of the tree.\n",

    "For any tree:\n",

    "Why?\n",
    "Think of the tree as being \"peeled\" layer by layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "You remove all leaves in each round.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each round, the inner structure of the tree is revealed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, you are left with:\n",

    "What is happening here?\n",
    "During each iteration of the while loop, we are removing leaves, i.e., nodes with only 1 connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each leaf has exactly one neighbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we remove the leaf, the neighbor loses one connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "After removing enough leaves, some of the neighbors themselves become leaves, i.e., their degree becomes 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this check is required\n",
    "✅ You only want to add nodes to new_leaves when they have exactly 1 remaining connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't check this, you might:\n",
    "\n",
    "Add nodes that aren't leaves yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process incorrect nodes in the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Break the logic of layer-by-layer removal.\n",

    "Visual Example\n",
    "Consider this:\n",

    "0 - 1 - 2 - 3\n",
    "Initial Leaves: [0, 3]\n",
    "Remove 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighbor 1 loses one connection, now degree is 1 → becomes a leaf → added to new_leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remove 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighbor 2 loses one connection, now degree is 1 → becomes a leaf → added to new_leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't check len(adj[neighbor]) == 1, you might add nodes prematurely or incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "✔ This condition ensures that you only add valid leaves for the next iteration.\n",
    "✔ It prevents processing incorrect nodes, maintaining the correctness of the \"peeling\" process.\n",
    "✔ Without this, the algorithm could break or give incorrect output.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-Line Takeaway\n",
    "➡ It detects when a neighbor has become a leaf after the current round of removals and queues it for processing in the next layer."
