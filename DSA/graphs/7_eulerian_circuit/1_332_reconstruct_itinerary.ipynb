    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† High-Level Idea:\n",
    "‚ÄúWe're given a list of tickets and need to reconstruct a valid itinerary starting from 'JFK', using all tickets exactly once, and among all possible valid itineraries, we must return the lexicographically smallest one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, I model the tickets as a directed graph, where each airport is a node, and each ticket is a directed edge. Since we need the itinerary in lexicographic order, I store the destinations in a min-heap (heapq) for each departure node. This helps efficiently retrieve the next smallest destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I use Hierholzer‚Äôs algorithm ‚Äî which is used to find Eulerian paths ‚Äî but customized for lexicographic order. The idea is to perform a post-order DFS. Once we reach an airport that has no further destinations, we backtrack and add it to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we add airports after visiting their destinations, the result is in reverse, so I reverse it at the end.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "üß© Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n",
    "Build the graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a defaultdict(list) to store outgoing flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use heapq so that when we pop destinations, we always get the lex smallest one first.\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS traversal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start from 'JFK', and for each airport, while there are destinations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pop the smallest destination and recurse into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we reach a node with no outgoing flights, we add it to the result list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reverse the result at the end to get the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Why this works:\n",
    "It ensures all tickets are used exactly once, because we consume edges as we traverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lexicographical order is guaranteed by using a min-heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DFS guarantees that we only backtrack when there are no more outgoing paths, ensuring correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "üí° Interviewer-Friendly Analogy:\n",
    "Think of this like delivering packages following a fixed route. At each stop, you always take the alphabetically first delivery route available. Once all packages from a hub are delivered, you backtrack and mark it complete."

    "## Follow up questions\n",
    "\n",
    "üîÅ 1. Why do you reverse the result at the end? Can we avoid reversing it?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "We reverse the result because we're doing a post-order DFS traversal: we only add an airport to the result after exploring all its outgoing paths. That means the final airport (i.e. end of the path) gets added first. So, to get the correct order of travel, we reverse the list at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding reversal would require us to prepend to the result at each step (e.g., result.insert(0, airport)), but this would be inefficient (O(n¬≤) time due to repeated shifting). So reversing once at the end (O(n)) is more optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "üßä 2. Why do we use a heapq instead of just sorting the adjacency list once?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Sorting the adjacency list once before DFS could work if we didn‚Äôt modify it. However, since we remove elements (edges) as we use them (to prevent reuse), sorting once won‚Äôt guarantee lex order during traversal if multiple destinations exist.\n",
    "Using a heapq ensures that each pop gives us the lex smallest next destination, even as we remove edges dynamically. It's both efficient (O(log k) per pop) and guarantees correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "üîÅ 3. Can this problem be solved using an iterative approach?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Yes, it can be solved using an iterative version of Hierholzer‚Äôs algorithm with a stack. Instead of using recursion for DFS, we maintain a stack and process nodes iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "stack = ['JFK']\n",
    "result = []\n",
    "\n",
    "while stack:\n",
    "    while graph[stack[-1]]:\n",
    "        stack.append(heapq.heappop(graph[stack[-1]]))\n",
    "    result.append(stack.pop())\n",
    "\n",
    "return result[::-1]\n",
    "This avoids recursion depth issues and works similarly to the recursive version.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚õìÔ∏è 4. What if there are multiple valid itineraries with the same lexical order?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "By problem definition, only one valid itinerary will be returned ‚Äî the lexicographically smallest one.\n",
    "Our algorithm ensures this by always picking the smallest lexicographic destination first using the heapq, and since we consume each edge exactly once, only one unique itinerary will be constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "üîÄ 5. How do we ensure that all tickets are used exactly once?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "We consume each ticket (edge) by popping it from the heap once it is used in DFS. Since each ticket is popped and never reused, each ticket is guaranteed to be used exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, Hierholzer‚Äôs algorithm naturally ensures that all edges in an Eulerian path are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùå 6. What would you do if no valid itinerary exists (e.g., some tickets are disconnected)?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "In this problem, it's guaranteed that at least one valid itinerary exists and uses all the tickets. But in a more general setting, we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "Track the number of edges used, and compare it with len(tickets).\n",
    "\n",
    "If after DFS, the number of airports in result is not len(tickets) + 1, it means not all tickets were used, so we can return an error or [].\n",
    "\n",
    "üåç 7. Can you improve space complexity?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "We use space for:\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph: O(E) = O(n) for n tickets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result: O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursion stack: O(n) in the worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "There‚Äôs not much room to improve space further because we must store the graph and final path. However, we can switch from recursion to iteration to save stack space.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß™ 8. What would you change if multiple starting points were allowed (not just 'JFK')?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "We would:\n",
    "\n",
    "Find all possible starting nodes with non-zero out-degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try all such nodes as possible starting points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use backtracking or track multiple valid Eulerian paths to find one that uses all tickets and is lexicographically smallest."
