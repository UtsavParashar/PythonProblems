    "In the solutions of leetcode 542 why are we placing the coordinates of 0 in queue\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT said:\n",
    "Great question! Placing the coordinates of all the 0 cells in the queue at the start of LeetCode 542 solution is a key part of optimizing the BFS approach. Here's the clear reasoning:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Why do we place coordinates of all 0s in the queue initially?\n",
    "Because the problem asks:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each cell, find the distance to the nearest 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "All cells containing 0 are considered sources for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We perform a multi-source BFS, where we expand outwards from all 0 positions simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guarantees that each 1 cell will be updated with the shortest distance to its nearest 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Analogy: Think of 0s as fire stations, and you want to compute distance of every cell to its nearest fire station. You start expanding from all fire stations at once.\n",
    "✅ Step-by-Step Intuition\n",
    "Initialize a matrix to track distances (dist) or modify mat in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Place all coordinates of 0s into the queue. Their distance is already 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "From these positions, BFS explores neighboring cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a neighboring cell hasn't been updated yet (distance is inf or large number), we set its distance to current_distance + 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add that neighboring cell to the queue to continue the BFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Why Not Start BFS from 1s?\n",
    "If you start BFS from each 1, you'd need to perform BFS separately for each 1, leading to a brute-force solution with high time complexity — potentially O(m² * n²).\n",
    "\n",
    "Placing all 0s in the queue initially:\n",
    "✔ Ensures each cell is visited only once.\n",
    "✔ Guarantees correct shortest distance is calculated.\n",
    "✔ Reduces time complexity to O(m * n).\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Quick Code Reference\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "for r in range(rows):\n",
    "    for c in range(cols):\n",
    "        if mat[r][c] == 0:\n",
    "            dist[r][c] = 0\n",
    "            queue.append((r, c))\n",
    "OR in in-place version:\n",

    "    for c in range(cols):\n",

    "        else:\n",
    "            mat[r][c] = float('inf')\n",
    "✅ Summary\n",
    "We put all 0s in the queue initially because:\n",
    "✔ They are the starting points for distance calculation.\n",
    "✔ It enables efficient multi-source BFS.\n",
    "✔ It avoids redundant processing and ensures the optimal, shortest distances are computed in one pass.\n"
